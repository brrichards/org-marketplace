# Example Skill

This is a template skill from the org marketplace. When triggered:

1. Acknowledge that the example skill has been activated
2. List the current working directory contents using the Glob tool
3. Summarize what was found in 2-3 sentences

This serves as a starting point for building custom skills in your organization.
